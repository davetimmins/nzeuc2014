					<p>
						What is it?
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS is an intuitive what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) application
						that allows you to easily build web applications without writing a single
						line of code. It includes powerful tools to configure fully featured
						HTML web applications. As you add your map and tools, you can visually see
						them in the app and use them right away.

						Think of it as the HTML5 and JS equivalent of Silverlight and Flex Builders

						Delivers pure HTML-based applications that work on desktop browsers, tablets, and even smart phones
						Completely integrated within the ArcGIS Online and Portal for ArcGIS platforms
						Provides over 30 out-of-the-box widgets, such as mapping, query, geoprocessing, analysis, editing, and printing, and so on
						Supports both 2D and 3D map applications
						Extensible framework for developers to create widgets or themes, and embed them in applications

						To access Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS, you must have ArcGIS Online organization account or Portal for ArcGIS account
						Currently at beta 2 so need to sign up at https://betacommunity.esri.com

					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Off-panel widgets are available as part of a theme but not addable to
						the widgets' controller. They can be turned on or off but cannot be removed
						 from the application. When the Widget tab is activated, the off-panel
						 widgets embedded in a theme display. An off-panel widget does not have
						 a panel and cannot be contained by header or side controllers.

						Attribute table—Displays a tabular view of a feature layer's attributes.
						Coordinate—Displays coordinates in the current map projection when moving the cursor on the map or in other coordinate systems by clicking the map.
						Geocoder—Enables finding a location on the map.
						Home Button—Click to zoom to map's initial extent.
						My Location—Detects your physical location and zooms the map to it.
						Overview Map—Shows the current spatial extent of the map display as a grey rectangle relative to the entire spatial extent of the basemap service.
						Scalebar—Displays a scalebar on the map

					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						In-panel widgets are available to the widget controllers and can be
						 added to your application. By default, they are contained by a controller.
						Depending on which theme you select, they may show in the upper right
						 corner of the application with the header controller in a Foldable theme,
						 or on the left side of the application with the side controller in the
						 Tab theme.

						Each in-panel widget requires user interactions on the panel.
						In addition, in-panel widgets are associated with placeholders that
						define the position of an in-panel widget.
						Instead of displaying in the controller,
						an in-panel widget can also display in the placeholder.

						Basemap Gallery—Presents a gallery of basemaps and allows you to select one.
						Bookmark—Spatial bookmarks for quick navigation.
						Chart—Display charts for selected features.
						Directions—Calculates and displays directions between two or more locations.
						Draw—Draws basic graphics and texts on the map.

						into the widget folder.

						Widget I18N file (locale file) - Uses the strings.js file and puts
						it into the nls folder. For more information,
						see Dojo’s documentation at

						Widget style file - Uses the style.css file and puts it into the css
						 folder. Puts all the images used by the style into the images css
						 subfolder.

						An ArcGIS Web AppBuilder theme is a collection of user interface elements
						that define an app's look-and-feel, layout, app navigation,
						and on screen functional UI items such as scale bar, overview map, and so on.
						By developing a theme, you can create your application's interface,
						interactive user experience, and branding style.

						The theme elements includes widget panels, style sheets,
						and layout definitions and theme widgets.
						One app can include more than one theme, but can only use one theme
						while running.

						A Panel is a UI window that displays a widget's content.
						A Panel can be developed to have its own distinguish behaviors
						and style for a specific theme. For example, you can develop a
						Panel that can be dragged around the screen and have purple
						color style that matches your overall theme style.
						With the theme Panel, widget developers can focus on developing
						a widget's function and content without worrying about how the
						widget displays, which further simplifies the widget development task.
						A theme can contain multiple Panels.

						A Theme widget is no more than a regular Web AppBuilder widget in
						terms of coding. However, without this widget as part of the theme,
						the theme is not complete. For example, the Header Controller widget
						is part of the out-of-the-box theme, called Foldable theme.
						Header Controller is developed to navigate all the widgets configured
						into an app.
						Creating the Theme widget is also a mechanism to ensure a theme
						can be shared as whole.

						A Style is a CSS file that you can define your CSS rules in.
						One theme can contains multiple styles.

						A Layout theme is essentially an app configuration placing all
						the UI elements (widgets) on the screen.
						It also includes predefined position holders (placeholders) on
						the screen that can be configured with widgets in the GUI AppBuilder.
						A theme can have multiple layouts.


				    All theme elements are contained inside a folder.
						The folder name should be the same as the theme's name.
				    Similar to a widget, a theme must have an icon file named icon.png,
						which is under the \images folder.
				    The theme root folder contains a common.css file.
						It defines the style content that is common for all styles.
				    A theme can include multiple styles in the \styles folder.
				    Each style has a folder that is named the same as the style name.
						Each style must have a style.css file.
				    There must be a style named default.
				    A theme can include multiple panels in the \panels folder.
				    Each panel has a folder named the same as the panel name.
						Each panel must have a Panel.js file.
				    A theme can include multiple layouts in the \layouts folder.
				    Each layout has a folder named the same as the layout name.
				    Each layout must have a config.json file and an icon.png file.
				    There must be a layout named default.
				    There must be a manifest.json file to describe the theme's content.
